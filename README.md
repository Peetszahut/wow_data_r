# Data Visualization using R (WoW Dataset)
Data visualization for [World of Warcraft dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/warcraft-avatar-history) using R.  I ran into this dataset when I first started playing with machine learning 2-2.5 years ago.  I used the dataset to explore the R language.   

## Initial Processing
Originally went through the data in the beginning portion of the code to check what is missing and how I could use the data.  I knew quite a bit about this time frame in World of Warcraft, so I tried to come up with different graphs of content which I found interesting.

## Data Visualization

### # of New Max Level Players per Week over a Years time
I found this to be particularly interesting due to showing a trend when people tend to level up new characters.  The trend seems to follow the school calendar (which isn't surprising considering the average age group for these type of games).

### Race/Class Combo (with focus on Blood Elf Race)
Blood Elf's were always my favorite race in this game, so I wanted to see how many people shared my enthusiasm for them.  You can see from the graph, the Blood Elfs reign supreme in terms of race played.
